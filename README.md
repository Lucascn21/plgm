# PLGM - Old Portfolio NodeJs 

This is my first attempt of making a portfolio, it has been abandoned because i was spending lots of time reinventing the wheel trying to make an reactive site, so i stopped, learned React, got comfortable with it and remade the project fully in React:

[Deployed Portfolio](https://portfolio-lucascn21.vercel.app).

Below is an abstract of my thoughts at the moment of developing this project:

### What i was aiming for

A portfolio/presentation site, on Bootstrap 5, using the least amount of libraries and frameworks as i could.

### Things i've learned
Bootstrap is great but, in my opinion, as the site gets more content and style, the html gets too bloated.

Also, at times it felt like having bootstrap added an extra layer of specificity as i tried to customize bootstrap components style and behaviour.

As i found myself dealing with html elements in Js, pretty much mimicking a template engine, i am more than interested in React now. reutilizable versatile components? sign me up.

### What i have achieved
First and foremost, a website that i like, its almost as i envisioned it. (I tend to feature creep my personal projects as my ideas usually exceed my current knowledge or are outside of my comfort zone, for example: 
Manipulating the DOM was fairly easy for me even if i was doing something totally new, however the UI/UX was something in which i relied heavily on friends feedback).

I've gained some insights in the importance of mobile-first design and choosing the right front-end framework/libraries.

Feature creep did not cripple nor impaired this project. The scope felt just right, not too narrow, not too wide, not too safe, not daunting either.

### Things i would've done / will do differently
I would've not used Bootstrap other than for sketching or prototyping. 

I will learn react. (As soon as i deploy and share this site).

I will do a much cleaner and semantic html. 

I will do better on CSS code practices. 

I will focus on mobile-first.
