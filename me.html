                           <strong  class="accordion-collapse collapse show " aria-labelledby="AboutMe"  >Childhood</strong>
                           <p>
                               I was born on August, 1992. My parents were setting up a Family Game (Famicom) console with my grandparents, just as they were about to start playing, it seems i wanted to play as well so i decided its time to be born. In hindsight, it seems i've always orbitated around systems and games.<br>
                               My first interaction with computers was when i was about 3-5 years old <span class="text-muted fst-italic">(I've learned to read quite early, both english and spanish)</span>, my dad was my main influence, i used to sit next to him sometimes while he worked and i picked up some basics, he also used to teach or explain anything i asked; He had this "If he asks, hes able to understand" policy. <span class="text-muted fst-italic">(FYI, this is not always a good idea lol)</span><br>
                               The first things i've actually learned were:<br> 1) Loading Doom2 on Windows 3.11.<br> 2) Changing icons. <span class="text-muted fst-italic">(Icons that were important for my dad were changed to hamburguers, he was so mad, nowadays we would laugh about it)</span><br>
                               Afterwards we had every Windows iteration up to Windows XP. <span class="text-muted fst-italic">(Even Millenium, yikes)</span><br> That was me, learning computer basics and english along the way, by means of games, programs and my dad. 
                            </p>
                           <strong  class="accordion-collapse collapse show " aria-labelledby="AboutMe"  >Adolescence</strong>
                           <p>
                            <span class="fst-italic ">This is where i had my first encounters with coding, work enviroments and game development.</span> <br>
                               As my parents separated, each of us had to find ways to spend time together, my dad sometimes took me to his work. <span class="text-muted fst-italic">(Only when something urgent came up while we were meeting or going somewhere together)</span> Sometimes i had the opportunity to help out or be a part of his team's work there, and i would gladly do so as i do have an innate interest in helping others and the challenges were usually related to systems, office automation, etc... Things i've been familiarized with in my childhood.<br> 
                               I remember the first time, they were stuck for days with a couple of problems: Licensing their OS, some system-specific issue and they had lost a password for a protected spreadsheet. So they called my dad, as we were nearby, he drove us there. When we arrived, one of his coworkers was scratching her head in frustration, so he told her not to worry, and just leave it to me. <span class="text-muted fst-italic">(Both me and her were caught by surprise, i did not hesitate at the moment though)</span> I was able to troubleshoot everything and even left the team with some tools to deal with pesky spreadsheets.<br> At first everyone thought my dad was crazy and looked at us with wide-eyes when he said i would fix those issues, afterwards they were quite fond of me and we had some coffee and 'medialunas'. <span class="text-muted fst-italic">(Kind of like a Crossant)</span><br>
                               The easy-going teamwork-oriented agile enviroment that the team developed has always stuck out to me, at least here offices tended to be more hegemonic, rigid, apathetic. <span class="text-muted fst-italic">(This is now changing however, IT being on the forefront, which is part of the reason i want to work on IT)</span><br>
                               Many years later i learned that this moment was one of the proudest moments my dad had of me. In retrospective, i am proud as well.<br>
                               <br>
                               During this time, i've always tinkered with games, i recall modding some units in a game called 'Tiberian Sun' as my earliest attempt to introduce my ideas into something playable. The next big thing was 'Warcraft 3' and its editor, which allows you to even do some code, i once did a fully working skeleton faction, custom functions, triggers, spells and all.<br>
                               Then comes the advent of multiplayer games, i become an avid 'Wow' and 'Gunz' player. Eventually i felt like i peaked as a player and started delving into creating game servers, i join a few communities and start learning.
                               Soon i find myself learning SQL and C++.<br> At some point i ended up in a developer team for a gunz server. I remember providing some fixes to their DB, game client optimization and community moderation. I quickly fell out of love with the project, as the project manager only wanted to do in-game events and saw little value in my work, so i left.<br>
                               This is where i also start to take an interest in hardware <span class="text-muted fst-italic">(I've always liked hardware but this is where i started to really understand each part's characteristics, role and price )</span>, fueled by youtube's most known channels like 'LinusTechTips' and 'GamersNexus'. <br>Eventually, my mom saves enough money for some hardware and i get to build my first custom pc. 
                            </p>
                            <strong  class="accordion-collapse collapse show " aria-labelledby="AboutMe"  >Adulthood</strong>
                            <p>
                               <span class="fst-italic">This is where i realized and decided that i am going to be a developer.</span><br>
                               Continuing from my adolescence, i kept studying and finding more resources about hardware. <span class="text-muted fst-italic">(from what to look up when choosing a motherboard, to finding the platform Power Supply Model in any commonly sold branded PSU, so one can know specifically what components make up its power supply, arguably the most important hardware in any computer)</span><br>
                               At some point i did joined a facebook group dedicated to hardware, there i spent countless hours debating and helping others. Eventually i left because i've realized that i was spending way too much time there. I am still the go-to tech guy in my friends, family and work circles.<br>
                               As i finished high school, i wasnt sure what i wanted to do, i tried selling hardware. That was not for me, sometimes the hardware you have to sell is not the best for the client and i tend to side with the client, retail sales are usually devious here. I've also worked as a freelance technician.<br>
                               My dad introduced me to my current company, in which he was working at that moment. He is not the type of parent that would refer his son, he dreads nepotism, however he had bricked a cpu while changing thermal paste and i just happened to be there to pick him up that day for some morning coffee. He was not used to dealing with hardware at all.<span class="text-muted fst-italic">(let alone "modern" hardware as in post-Pentium 4 era, probably)</span> And didnt have the contacts to get parts, i offered help and he agreed. So within 2-3 hours i got a cpu, reassembled the pc, made sure everything was ok, and we had our coffee as well.<br>
                               Based on this event, i got a part-time position into the Human Resources department, interviewing candidates for employment and being responsible for the hardware and software. I eventually transitioned into Consultant, i no longer did interviews and i took part in modernizing the department's practices; For example, we used to rely on Outlook <span class="text-muted fst-italic">(using old messy protocols that had to be frequently flushed, in particular when we had "big" incoming emails)</span> and phone calls, we now use Whatsapp, an array of google's tools like Gmail, Sheets, Drive, Meet, etc... I've also implemented some much needed automations. Albeit against some resistance to change<br>
                               Not losing in sight that this is a job i like and do well but its not a job for me to build my carreer on, i've been focusing and investing in this one definitive goal that is becoming a developer.<br><br>
                             To summarize, during this time:<br><span class="fw-bolder">i've succesfully completed many programming courses, i am constantly learning and currently pursuing an IT Degree.<br>
                               I know many languages and i am capable of picking up new ones.<br>
                               As a game dev, i got the curiosity and resourcefulness that i believe are key towards creating a good game. I am learning Unity and Phaser.<br>
                               I have very good analytical abilites, i really enjoy solving problems and helping others.<br>
                               I want to be part in the creation of useful things.</span><br>
